# FullStackOpenExercises
Exercises for the Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development 2020 course from the University of Helsinki found at https://fullstackopen.com/en. My purpose for taking this course is to learn new skills and strengthen existing knowledge. This course covers topics such as React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript and focuses on modern JavaScript-based web development and building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs.
